def scale_free_tau(corrmat, skew_thresh, proportional=True):
    ''''
    Calculates threshold at which network becomes scale-free, estimated from the skewness of the networks degree distribution.
    Parameters
    ----------
    corrmat : numpy.array
        Correlation or other connectivity matrix from which tau_connected will be estimated.
        Should be values between 0 and 1.
    proportional : bool
        Determines whether connectivity matrix is thresholded proportionally or absolutely.
        Default is proportional as maintaining network density across participants is a priority
    Returns
    -------
    tau : float
        Lowest vaue of tau (threshold) at which network is scale-free.

    Parameters
    ----------

        Correlation or other connectivity matrix from which tau_connected will be estimated.
        Should be values between 0 and 1.
